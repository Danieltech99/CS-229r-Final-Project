Lessons

- When considering the regular (non-normalized) fiedler, it is possible to remove an edge and the fielder value stay the same.
- In the experiment, Small steps only did worse than big step one time, and this was a time when Big Step achived best. Both sometimes achieve best.
- Big step almost always cuts more edges than small step, there was once exception. 
- A graph can have the same fiedler value and different normalized fiedler values? What does this mean intuitively?
- How is that there is a case when the fiedler is 0 but the normalized fiedler is 1?
